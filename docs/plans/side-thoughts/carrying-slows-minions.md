# Carrying Slows Minions

## The Idea
When a minion is carrying an item back to base, their movement speed is reduced.

## Why It's Interesting
- Creates a **risk/reward tension**: minions carrying loot are slower and more vulnerable
- Opens up strategic choices: do you escort laden minions or leave them exposed?
- Could tie into item weight - heavier items = slower movement
- Makes the "return trip" feel different from the "go fetch" trip

## Design Questions
- How much slower? 50%? Scales with item weight?
- Visual indicator that minion is carrying something?
- Can carrying minions still be commanded to do other things (drop item)?

## When to Revisit
After basic collection is working and we have enemies that pose a threat.
