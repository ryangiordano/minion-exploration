# Game Loop Depth Ideas

Ideas for making the core loop (explore, collect treasure, beat enemies) more engaging.

## Resource Economy

### Minion Spawning Nodes
- Spend collected treasure at nodes to "buy" new minions
- Creates resource tension: invest in army vs. save for other uses
- Nodes become strategic map locations
- Visual: deposit treasure, minion pops out after brief incubation

### Minion Progression / XP
- Minions gain experience from combat or successful treasure delivery
- Leveled minions are stronger (more damage, HP, speed?)
- Losing a veteran hurts more than losing a rookie
- Visual indicator of level (size? glow? color intensity?)

## Stakes and Tension

### Player Vulnerability
- Enemies can target and damage the player directly
- Minions can "defend" - intercept attacks or draw aggro
- Creates emotional investment: minions are protectors, not just tools
- Player death = game over or major penalty

### Minion Permadeath
- Minions can die in combat (HP reaches 0)
- Combined with progression, creates meaningful loss
- Need balance: not so punishing it's frustrating, not so cheap death is meaningless

### Time Pressure / Waves
- Enemy waves spawn periodically, escalating difficulty
- Day/night cycle where night is more dangerous
- Forces player to keep moving rather than turtling
- Creates pacing: moments of exploration vs. frantic defense

## Map and Exploration

### Spatial Tension
- Treasure in dangerous areas, spawn nodes far from enemies
- Forces split attention and risky pushes
- Chokepoints and defensible positions matter

### Win Condition
- Collect all treasure to complete the level
- Or: survive X waves while collecting treasure
- Or: reach an extraction point with treasure

## Replayability (Roguelike Elements)

### Randomized Maps
- Procedural placement of treasure, enemies, nodes
- Each run feels different

### Minion Traits / Types
- Random traits on spawned minions (fast but fragile, tanky, etc.)
- Different minion types with unique abilities
- Unlock new types through meta-progression

### Run-Based Progression
- Permanent unlocks between runs
- Currency earned from runs to unlock new minion types, starting bonuses

## Priority for MVP

**Simple additions (build on what exists):**
1. Minion HP and death
2. Minion progression (basic XP/level system)
3. Player HP and vulnerability

**Medium complexity:**
4. Spawn nodes for minion recruitment
5. Win condition (collect all treasure)

**Larger scope (later):**
6. Enemy waves / time pressure
7. Roguelike elements
